## What are Proxies?

Think of a proxy as your **digital bodyguard**. When you browse the internet normally, websites can see your real location and identity. A proxy server sits between you and the websites you visit, acting on your behalf.

### Why Use Proxies?

## Test Your First Connection

Let's verify your proxies are working correctly. We'll test with a simple IP check.

### Method 1: Quick Browser Test ‚ö°

**For beginners - no coding required:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Extension">
    Install the [BirdProxies Switcher Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/birdproxies-switcher/finnjeoihjhofinoogogagdlpjjanjgm)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Credentials">
    - **Protocol**: HTTP
    - **Server**: Your endpoint (e.g., residential.birdproxies.com)
    - **Port**: Your port (e.g., 8080)
    - **Username**: Your username
    - **Password**: Your password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Connection">
    Enable the proxy and visit [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Success">
    ‚úÖ You should see a different IP than your real one
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Method 2: Command Line Test (cURL)

Quick test from terminal/command prompt:

```bash
# Replace with your actual credentials
curl -x http://birduser123:birdpass456@residential.birdproxies.com:8080 https://httpbin.org/ip

# Expected response:
# {  
#   "origin": "192.168.1.100"  # <- This should be different from your real IP
# }
```

### Method 3: Python Test Script

For developers - copy and run this script:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import requests

# Replace with your actual BirdProxies credentials
PROXY_USERNAME = "your_username_here"
PROXY_PASSWORD = "your_password_here" 
PROXY_ENDPOINT = "residential.birdproxies.com:8080"  # or your ISP endpoint

proxies = {
    'http': f'http://{PROXY_USERNAME}:{PROXY_PASSWORD}@{PROXY_ENDPOINT}',
    'https': f'http://{PROXY_USERNAME}:{PROXY_PASSWORD}@{PROXY_ENDPOINT}'
}

try:
    # Test the proxy connection
    response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip', proxies=proxies, timeout=10)
    proxy_ip = response.json()['origin']
    print(f"‚úÖ Success! Proxy IP: {proxy_ip}")
    
    # Test without proxy to compare
    real_response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip', timeout=10)
    real_ip = real_response.json()['origin']
    print(f"üè† Your real IP: {real_ip}")
    
    if proxy_ip != real_ip:
        print("üéâ Proxy is working correctly!")
    else:
        print("‚ùå Proxy might not be working - IPs are the same")
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå Connection failed: {e}")
    print("üí° Check your credentials and try again")
```

```javascript Node.js
const axios = require('axios');
const HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// Replace with your actual BirdProxies credentials
const PROXY_USERNAME = "your_username_here";
const PROXY_PASSWORD = "your_password_here";
const PROXY_ENDPOINT = "residential.birdproxies.com:8080";

const proxyUrl = `http://${PROXY_USERNAME}:${PROXY_PASSWORD}@${PROXY_ENDPOINT}`;
const httpsAgent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxyUrl);

async function testProxy() {
    try {
        // Test with proxy
        const proxyResponse = await axios.get('https://httpbin.org/ip', {
            httpsAgent: httpsAgent,
            timeout: 10000
        });
        const proxyIP = proxyResponse.data.origin;
        console.log(`‚úÖ Success! Proxy IP: ${proxyIP}`);
        
        // Test without proxy
        const realResponse = await axios.get('https://httpbin.org/ip', { timeout: 10000 });
        const realIP = realResponse.data.origin;
        console.log(`üè† Your real IP: ${realIP}`);
        
        if (proxyIP !== realIP) {
            console.log("üéâ Proxy is working correctly!");
        } else {
            console.log("‚ùå Proxy might not be working - IPs are the same");
        }
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`‚ùå Connection failed: ${error.message}`);
        console.log("üí° Check your credentials and try again");
